            <p class="comic-description">Set in many worlds, AMOK tells the story of Yusef Grenadier, a traveler who climbs up the celestial ladder in search of a way down. Plagued by his guilty conscience for leaving his people behind, he strives to find a token that grants him passage to previous worlds. His struggle is intensified once he notes that all calamity trickles down, causing more suffering the higher up he goes. With such inescapable plight, this nomad finds himself alone.</p>

                <p>The concept of "AMOK" was finalized at the end of 2022. It's characters and narratives we're written and illustrated by Manny L' Maverick. Any other artists are credited in the footnote of the comic's cover and are to receive proper acclaim for their part.</p>
