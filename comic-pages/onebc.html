            <p class="comic-description">It's been 140 years since felines developed higher intelligence in the United States. Political movements and progressive parties led to them being constituted as a new "race" in the humanitarian sense, leading to provisional civil rights. At first regarded as near-equals, things soon changed as their physique and mental aptitude enabled their more destructive tendencies. While they used to be considered tax paying citizens, they're now seen as demons and criminals.</p>
            <p class="comic-description">Brinkley Cruz is a blue, six-foot-two anthropomorphic cat who works as a courier in the inner cities. He makes his living peddling drugs off the rooftops of his Pennsylvania neighborhood. Bold and unabashedly reckless, he works to satiate his narcotic habits. A lost soul with an excentric gaze—at least he isn't alone.</p>
